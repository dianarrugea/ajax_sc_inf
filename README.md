*   A function that can GET all locations or a single location (endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#location) - needs to call the generic function

*   A function that can GET all episodes or a single episode (endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#episode) - needs to call the generic function
